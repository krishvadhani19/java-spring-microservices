In Java, String and StringBuffer are both used to work with strings, but they have key differences in terms of mutability, thread safety, and performance:

1. Mutability:
String: Immutable. Once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed. Any modification (like concatenation) results in the creation of a new String object, which can be inefficient in scenarios with frequent string manipulation.
StringBuffer: Mutable. It allows modifications to the string it holds without creating a new object, which makes it more efficient for scenarios involving lots of changes.

2. Thread Safety:
String: As it is immutable, it is inherently thread-safe. Multiple threads can access the same String object without worrying about synchronization issues.
StringBuffer: Thread-safe. Methods of StringBuffer are synchronized, meaning that it is safe to use in a multi-threaded environment without causing thread interference.

3. Performance:
String: Slower for repeated modifications because each change results in the creation of a new object.
StringBuffer: Faster for scenarios where frequent modifications are needed, especially in a single-threaded environment, because it modifies the existing object.

4. Use Case:
String: Use when the string content will not change, or when only a few modifications are required.
StringBuffer: Use when you need to frequently modify a string in a thread-safe manner.
